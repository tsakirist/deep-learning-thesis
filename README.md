## Deep Learning Frameworks' Effectiveness and Efficiency for Time Series Prediction ##


### Abstract ###

---

The speed and efficiency of predicting the values of a time series is important in a variety of areas such as stock exchanges, seismic studies and sensor networks. The aim of this dissertation is to tackle this specific task with deep learning and explore the prediction efficiency and the speed of training and
prediction of the popular deep learning frameworks and libraries. Focus is put on "Long Short-Term Memory" (LSTM) and "Gated Recurrent Unit" (GRU) networks, variants of "Recurrent Neural Networks" (RNN) which are specifically designed to handle sequences, like time series. The forecasting models are built with Keras, a high-level deep learning library, that allows the use of different low-level deep learning frameworks (Tensorflow, Theano,
CNTK ) as its backend engine, which makes it feasible to make a fair comparison between them.
